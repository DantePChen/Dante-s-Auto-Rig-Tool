# Dante's Auto Rig Tool
This is a tool that is still in developing, for now it can only rig one side of hand with fingers.
The tool is wrote in seperate module, so it just take time to expand to the full body.
features for now:
1. IK_FK seamless switch without any plugins needed, all you just need to do is open it and use it.
2. Using matrix to replace all the constrain nodes, so it should have sightly performance improvement.
